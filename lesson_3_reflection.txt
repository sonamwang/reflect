when would like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	we always don't want to pull all the functionality of other developer, so we get choose which branch need to pull in the local repository using command "git pull name_of_remote_repo name_of_remote_branch"
